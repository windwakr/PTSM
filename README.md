**Note: This has been modified to only dump save files for Kuruma de DS**

# PTSM

Homebrew for dumping and restoring savegames for Learn With Pok√©mon: Typing Adventure. Additionally you can dump the content of the flash chip inside the cartridge, or test the bluetooth chip.

Requires SD card access; tested on 3DS with [TWiLightMenu](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu) (DSi should work fine).

## Thanks
